# Hello hclcode!

Here is the simplest possible "hello world" example of using hclcode:

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<div class="chat-transcript" markdown="1">

#### change hello to goodbye

To change the output from "hello" to "goodbye", we need to modify the `hello.py` file.

Here is the change:

```python
hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("hello")
=======
print("goodbye")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

> Applied edit to hello.py  
> Commit 672ae42 hclcode: Changed output from "hello" to "goodbye" in hello.py.
