# hclcode is AI pair programming in your terminal

hclcode lets you pair program with LLMs,
to edit code in your local git repository.
Start a new project or work with an existing git repo.
hclcode works best with GPT-4o & Claude 3.5 Sonnet and can 
[connect to almost any LLM](https://hclcode.chat/docs/llms.html).
